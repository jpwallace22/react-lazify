## **Features**

Will change any selected default import into a React Lazy import. Is this really hard to do? No.. However, I was tired of writing out lazy imports.

To use the extension:

- Select the component you wish to change to a lazy import
  - Supports selections with multiple cursors and highlighting (will ignore non-default imports)
- Use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+opt+cmd+L` to make it lazy
  - If you hate the keybinding. Feel free to change it to whatever you want.
- You can also use the command palette (`shift+cmd+P`) and select Lazify

Since this is all about being **lazy** you can also convert your imports straight from your JSX. Same instructions from above. But in the JSX.

- Select the component you wish to covert
- Supports selections with multiple cursors and highlighting (will STILL ignore non-default imports)
- Use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+opt+cmd+L` to make it lazy

## **Extension Settings**

- Default keyboard shortcut â€” `ctrl+opt+cmd+L`

### Optional Settings

```ts
// settings.json

 // If true, all imports will use React.lazy() instead of lazy()
"lazify.imports.useDefaultReactImport": boolean; // default = false
```

## **Requirements**

- Lightweight and dependency free.
- Tested on Linux, Mac, and Windows OS
- Only works in `.jsx` and `.tsx` files. (But I couldn't imagine why you would need it in any other type of file.)

## **Known Issues**

No known issues at this time, though I'm sure there will be plenty to come. If you want to help, **PLEASE** report any issues or feature requests [on Github](https://github.com/jpwallace22/react-lazify/issues)
