# React Lazify <image src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpwallace22/react-lazify/main/src/assets/react-lazy.png" width="50px">

## Features

Will change any selected default import into a React Lazy import. Is this really hard to do? No.. however I wanted to learn how to make an extension and I was tired of writing out lazy imports.

To use the extension:

- Select the line

Feel free to re-bind it to any key combo you wish

> Incoming: A small video to show how it works.

## Requirements

Very lightweight and dependency free. If you have VS code, this should work.

## Extension Settings

Enable the extension.

## Known Issues

This is an alpha release.. There will be plenty of issues to come. If you want to help, please report them [here](https://github.com/jpwallace22/react-lazify/issues) on Github

## Todo

- enable multiline ability.
- decide where to move the new lazy import to.

## Release Notes

This is a VERY early release. Maybe even too early to be called alpha
